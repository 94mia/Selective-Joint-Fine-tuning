### Introduction

This repository contains the codes and models described in the paper "Borrowing Treasures from the Wealthy: Deep Transfer Learning through Selective Joint Fine-tuning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08690). These models are those used in [Stanford Dogs 120] (http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/), [Oxford Flowers 102](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/), [Caltech 256](http://authors.library.caltech.edu/7694/) and [MIT Indoor 67](http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html).
